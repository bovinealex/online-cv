    summary: |
        The classic question posed to college students
        when home for the holidays is: "how is school
        going?" My responses varied, but remained along
        the same theme. I would gush about my job, research
        positions, and occasionally mention classes. 

education:
    - degree: University of California, Berkeley

        College is a time for experementation, so I did a lot of that.
        A little anthropology there, a hearty serving of 
        computer science here, you get the picture. My choices of
        classes were often informed by topics I discovered at work.
