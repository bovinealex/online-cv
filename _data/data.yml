    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        The classic question posed to college students
        when home for the holidays is: "how is school
        going?" My responses varied, but remained along
        the same theme. I would gush about my job, enthusiastically
        explain research positions, and occasionally mention 
        my classes.

        College is a time for experementation, so I did a lot of that.
        A little anthropology there, a hearty serving of 
        computer science here, you get the picture. My choices of
        classes were often informed by topics I discovered at work, 
        including:
        - Computer Science 8, 10, 61A
        - Statistics 8
        - 4.0 GPA overall

          ability to preserve phylogenetically unique wildlife
          - Performed PCA to determine the variables that are most likely to cause genetic 
          diversity in legless lizards, based on maps outlining vegetation, 
          temperature, precipitation, and soil.
